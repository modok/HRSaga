## Once upon a time...
In the *Magical Realm* new missions start every day.  
*Captains* go all over the realm to find and hire *Warriors* and *Wizards* to join their *squads*.  
*Captains* are free to organise their squad as they like with a mix of Warriors and Wizards up to 5 in total.  
Once the *squad* is ready a *Captain* can sign off a *mission* in the *bullettin board* located in the *tarvern*  
Once signed off a *squad* and its *Captain* begins its *mission*, when the *mission* is completed the *Captain* earn *10gp*  

Things worked well so far, but a new *Overlord* is ruling the *Magical Realm* and he already anticipated that things are going to change

### Month 1 
The new *Overlord* of *Magical Realm* for the incoming year ruled that all the Captains in hiring Warriors and Wizards should pass for the *HR fairies* that are the only ones can authorise a hiring.
*HR fairies* evaluate each *Warrior* and *Wizard* resume and if they are at least a level 1, they allow *Warriors* and *Wizards* to join a *Captain*' *squad*.
